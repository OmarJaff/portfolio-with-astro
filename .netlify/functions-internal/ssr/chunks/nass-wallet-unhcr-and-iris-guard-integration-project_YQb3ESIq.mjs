My role was to ensure seamless communication, understand the unique requirements, and tackle any challenges that came our way.\n1. **Understanding the IrisGuard API:**\n   - Delving into the IrisGuard API, I worked to grasp the intricacies, aligning our team and resolving any uncertainties to deliver a service that met the highest standards.\n1. **Solving Challenges for a Smooth Service:**\n   - Every project has its challenges, and this one was no different. My responsibility was to dissolve unclear points, ensuring a smooth service delivery. It was like piecing together a complex puzzle to make sure everything fit perfectly.\n\n---\n\n**Impact and Pride:**\n\nAfter pushing this service live, the impact was immense. UNHCR could seamlessly pay over 200,000 refugees who had fled to Iraq due to neighboring conflicts. This service, utilizing IrisGuard technology, read the human iris, matched results with a backend batch system, and validated end-users for secure transactions.\n\n**Proud to be a Part:**\n\nI take immense pride in being part of this significant project. It's more than just technology; it's about using innovation to make a real difference. Being able to assist UNHCR in utilizing NassWallet services to support those in need is a testament to the power of technology for positive change.\n";
